# Assignment 1 - Even and Odd

#### Directions
1. Create a new project folder to house this new project and create a `main.go` file inside of it
2. In the `main.go` file, define a function called main. Remember that the main function will be called automatically
3. In the main function, create a slice of ints from 0 through 10
4. Iterate through the slice with a for loop. For each element, check to see if the number is even or odd
5. If the value is even, print out "even". If it is odd, print out "odd"
6. Run your code from the terminal
7. Output should be as follows
```
0 is even
1 is odd
2 is even
3 is odd
4 is even
5 is odd
6 is even
7 is odd
8 is even
9 is odd
10 is even
